# ITI Assignments Repository

This repository contains the assignments of ITI (Information Technology Institute). The assignments are organized by days and categorized into two main folders: MVC and API.

## MVC Assignments

The MVC folder contains assignments related to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It consists of nine subfolders, each representing a separate day's assignment. Inside each day's folder, you will find the code files and a corresponding PNG file that explains the assignment visually.

## API Assignments

The API folder contains assignments related to building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It consists of three subfolders, each representing a separate day's assignment. Similar to the MVC assignments, each day's folder contains code files and a PNG file explaining the assignment details.

## About the Assignments

The assignments in this repository are designed to provide practical exercises for ITI students. Each day's assignment focuses on a specific topic or concept related to MVC or API development. The assignments help students gain hands-on experience and reinforce their understanding of the subject matter.

## Instructor

The assignments in this repository are provided by Dr. Christen.
